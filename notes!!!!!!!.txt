ExerciseSuggestion.kt: data model for exercise suggestions + a small list of mock data.

ApiSuggestionsScreen.kt: UI for the API Suggestions page, shows the cards and “Try” button using the mock data.

MainActivity.kt: temporarily set to open ApiSuggestionsScreen() on launch for testing.

These can be adjusted or removed after the project is completed and are mainly for collaboration reference.
